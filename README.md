# customer-industry-analysis
This repository provides a text mining and natural language processing (NLP) workflow to analyze company customer names, extract root words using stemming and lemmatization, and generate insights for industry categorization.

The workflow combines R and Python:

R Text Mining: Cleans and preprocesses customer company names, removing punctuation, numbers, stopwords, and whitespace. Generates a term frequency table from the customer data.

Python NLP: Applies stemming and lemmatization to normalized terms, producing root words for consistent analysis. This allows identification of common patterns in company names and helps define industry categories.

Output:

Term frequency tables with root words

Excel/TXT files for further analysis

Optional word cloud visualizations for quick insights
